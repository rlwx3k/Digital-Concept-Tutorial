# Markdown for Beginners

## Megan Winans

The purpose of this tutorial is to help guide people who may have just started out using GitHub and Markdown through the process of what it
is and how exactly they can create something utilizing them. (May update it to better convey what's actually in the tutorial).

The target audience for this tutorial is people with possibly little, if no, knowledge regarding how to use GitHub and Markdown, hence the
use of the word beginners in the tutorial's name.

I decided to do this as my tutorial because I felt extremely lost my first time around using GitHub and trying to do an assignment using
Markdown and different pages, so I want others to be able to actually know how to navigate their way around instead of having to dig a hole 
to find how to use them.
