## Making Your Markdown Project

After making your repository, you should be greeted with your README.md file had you initialized it with one. What it did
was it turned your repository's name into a header using Markdown (which is why there's a # and a space before where it has 
your repository's name) and added its description into the file as well if you provided one at the start. The .md after the
file's name is important, as that is how you're able to use Markdown in the file you're working with.

If you're wanting to add any additional file or files to your repository besides your README one, depending on what's on your screen, you may need to click on the little icon to the left of where it states your repository's name on the top of the page
and where it states that you're on the main branch of your repository, which for the purpose of this tutorial, I won't be 
getting into. After you've opened your file tree, you can now see a list of all your files, and, if you're wanting to add another one, you click on the + sign next to the magnifying glass. You are then taken to a brand new file page, where you can
name it something relative to what it's about. **Make sure to end your file name in .md if you want to use Markdown in it.**

From there, you may either choose to cancel changes, which in the case you've just created it, doesn't proceed with making the file, or you may choose to commit changes, which saves your file's creation and what all you've put in it so far. If you're ever wanting to re-edit your file, you can go to your file's page and click on the little pencil icon that's on the right side of your project's little navigation bar, where you can also preview what it looks like, its code, and its blame, where it displays the changes you've made to your file.
