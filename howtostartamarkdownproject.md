## How to Start a Markdown Project in GitHub

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and log-in to it. If not, create one; it's free to do!

2. There's two ways you can do this, but the next step is to create a new repository, which is basically
   GitHub's way of saying a project.
   
     -You may either create one through your Dashboard on the left-hand
     side of the screen, where it says Top repositories and by clicking the green button that says New, with
     a little book icon to the left of it.
   
     -Or you can go up to where your profile icon is located in the top
     right hand corner of your screen, click on it, then click on Your repositories, and then click the green
     button with the book icon next to New.

3. Name your repository something that reflects what your project is or what you would like to use it for. Then,
   you may go into a little bit of detail about what your project is about by adding in a description for it;
   however, that is not necessary to do. After the description section, you can set it to where your repository
   is either public or private. For the sake of beginning it, I would recommend setting it to public. The main
   other thing to add is a README file, which you may choose to have your repository initialized with. Since this
   file usually serves as the main/home page of your project, it would be beneficial to add it to it; plus, it is
   automatically set up to be used with Markdown. Finally, click on the Create repository button on the bottom of
   the screen and you're ready to get into it!
