## What GitHub and Markdown Are

The simplest explanation as to what GitHub is can best be described as a platform for people to work on their projects, either
separately or with others. It is quite useful in the developing world, as it can be used to showcase one's range of talents
and previous projects worked upon to potential employers.

As for Markdown, collectively, it is just a way to format text using a variety of compositions from the keyboard, such as asterisks (*)
and hashtags/pound symbols (#). Granted, it can vary based on where you use it. There is Markdown's basic core elements that can be 
used regardless of where you use it at, whereas some more extensive ones fluctuate and are specific to where it's being implemented, 
as it will either acknowledge its composition or ignore it. What I will cover in this Markdown tutorial for beginners is some of the most
useful Markdown elements, in my opinion.
