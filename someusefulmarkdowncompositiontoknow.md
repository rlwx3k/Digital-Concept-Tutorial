## Some Useful Markdown Composition to Know

**Remember: You can always view the code for this page to see its Markdown composition!**

### Headers
As I have used throughout this tutorial, headers are an important part of Markdown pages. They can be used when putting the
required number of # marks and a space before the header's text. Note that if you do not put a space between the # marks and
the text, it won't register it as a header. There are three different header sizes: one # for the biggest size, ## for the medium size, and ### for the smallest size. For the first two size options, also take note that the program draws a
horizontal line under the respective header, as can be seen below:
# The largest header size.
## The second largest header size/medium size.

### Italicizing and Bolding Text
Knowing how to put emphasis on text is helpful, especially when you're wanting to draw attention to a particular section of it. In order to italicize text, all you need to do is surround the text you want to italicize in one asterisk (*) on both sides of the text, like so: *this text is italicized*. In order to bold text, all you need to do is surround the text you
want to bold with two asterisks on both sides of the text, like so: **this text is bolded**.

### Lists
Lists can be implemented in Markdown quite easily. The composition you use depends on whether you want your list ordered or not. For an ordered/numbered list, just start out with the number one and a period after it, then, after typing in the first list item's contents, you can hit enter and it will automatically give you the next item in the list. For a dash marks/unordered list, you can start out with a dash (-) mark, type in its contents, and, like the numbered list, hit enter and then continue on typing the next thing in the list. Make sure that the starting text and what's indicating the list have a space in between them starting out with, or else it won't register as a list.

### How to Implement Links
Including links in Markdown isn't tricky; however, what I found difficult at first was how to navigate in between the different Markdown pages, as I did in this tutorial. All you need to do is surround the title you want to be displayed for your link in brackets [ ] and, afterwards, place the link of your destination in parentheses ( ), meaning there's not a space between the two items. For example, if you want to be able to navigate easily between your other file pages, you will need to get the URL of them and paste them into the file you want to be able to navigate from. An example of this implementation can be found in the Tutorial Navigation section, which is found below.
