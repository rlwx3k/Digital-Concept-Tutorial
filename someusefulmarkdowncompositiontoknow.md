## Some Useful Markdown Composition to Know

**Remember: You can always view the code for this page to see its Markdown composition!**

### Headers
As I have used throughout this tutorial, headers are an important part of Markdown pages. They can be used when putting the
required number of # marks and a space before the header's text. Note that if you do not put a space between the # marks and
the text, it won't register it as a header. There are three different header sizes: one # for the biggest size, ## for the medium size, and ### for the smallest size. For the first two size options, also take note that the program draws a
horizontal line under the respective header, as can be seen below:
# The largest header size.
## The second largest header size/medium size.

### Italicizing and Bolding Text
Knowing how to put emphasis on text is helpful, especially when you're wanting to draw attention to a particular section of it. In order to italicize text, all you need to do is surround the text you want to italicize in one asterisk (*) on both sides of the text, like so: *this text is italicized*. In order to bold text, all you need to do is surround the text you
want to bold with two asterisks on both sides of the text, like so: **this text is bolded**.
