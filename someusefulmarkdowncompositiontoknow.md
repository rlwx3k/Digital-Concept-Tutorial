## Some Useful Markdown Composition to Know

**Remember: You can always view the code for this page to see its Markdown composition!**

### Headers
As I have used throughout this tutorial, headers are an important part of Markdown pages. They can be used when putting the
required number of # marks and a space before the header's text. Note that if you do not put a space between the # marks and
the text, it won't register it as a header. There are three different header sizes: one # for the biggest size, ## for the medium size, and ### for the smallest size. For the first two size options, also take note that the program draws a
horizontal line under the respective header, as can be seen below:
# The largest header size.
## The second largest header size/medium size.

### Italicizing and Bolding Text
Knowing how to put emphasis on text is helpful, especially when you're wanting to draw attention to a particular section of it. In order to italicize text, all you need to do is surround the text you want to italicize in one asterisk (*) on both sides of the text, like so: *this text is italicized*. In order to bold text, all you need to do is surround the text you
want to bold with two asterisks on both sides of the text, like so: **this text is bolded**.

### Lists
Lists can be implemented in Markdown quite easily. The composition you use depends on whether you want your list ordered or not. For an ordered/numbered list, just start out with the number one and a period after it, then, after typing in the first list item's contents, you can hit enter and it will automatically give you the next item in the list. For a dash marks/unordered list, you can start out with a dash (-) mark, type in its contents, and, like the numbered list, hit enter and then continue on typing the next thing in the list.
