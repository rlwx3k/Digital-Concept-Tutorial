## Some Useful Markdown Composition to Know

### Headers
As I have used throughout this tutorial, headers are an important part of Markdown pages. They can be used when putting the
required number of # marks and a space before the header's text. Note that if you do not put a space between the # marks and
the text, it won't register it as a header. There are three different header sizes: one # for the biggest size, ## for the medium size, and ### for the smallest size.
